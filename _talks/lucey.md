bio: |
   I have recently accepted the position of Director of Data Science at STATS. Previously, I was an Associate Research Scientist at Disney Research Pittsburgh, where I conducted research into Group Behavior and Sport Analytics. My research centers on representing, learning and predicting both cooperative and adversarial groups using spatiotemporal data - with application to continuous sports and audience domains.  Before that, I was  at the Robotics Institute at CMU as well as at the Faculty of Psychology at the University of Pittsburgh where I conducted my research on using facial expressions to aid in the diagnosis of medical conditions (such as Pain, Depression and Facial Paralysis) with Prof. Jeff Cohn.  
abstract: |
   Imagine watching a sports game live and having the ability to find all plays which are similar to what just happened immediately. Better still, imagine having the ability to draw a play with the x’s and o’s on an interface, like a coach draws up on a chalkboard and finding all the plays like that instantaneously and conduct analytics on those plays (i.e., when those plays occur, how many points a team expects from that play). Additionally, imagine having the ability to evaluate the performance of a player in a given situation and compare it against another player in exactly the same position. We call this approach “Interactive Sports Analytics” and in this talk, I will describe methods to find play similarity using multi-agent trajectory data, as well as predicting fine-grain plays. I will show examples using STATS SportVU data in basketball, Prozone data in soccer and Hawk-Eye in tennis.
