abstract: |
   Statistics is at least as much an art as it is a science. Nowhere is this blend more clear than in the area of data and information visualization. One of the key open questions is how datavisualization fits in to the data analytic process and how decisions made by analysts during exploratory data analysis impact downstream statistical models. In this talk I will discuss evidence based data analysis, how we can use large scale teaching platforms to experiment with visualizations, and how we can use this to move the art of data analysis toward a science.
